# Wepa Status Page Monitor
# Created by Nicholas Charles Freberg
# Written for the Use of the ResNet Department at Bridgewater State University
# Essentially, this is a webscraper that takes the data from the WEPA Print Status Page at https://cs.wepanow.com/000BRIDGEW149.html&filter=
# Every minute, the application updates the table to show if any printers need attention
